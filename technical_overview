#Technical Overview

Here it is explained how the script works.
First, the script reads the doc name that contains the url list and passes its value to a variable that it is a list that contains all the urls.
From that, the script will request access to those websites and search for two things:
1 - Any phone numbers found
To do that, it's used regular expressions to search for known numbers formats and every number that fits in those formats is added to a list.
However, a phone can belong to two different formats, for example, +1 (478) 389-9083 belongs to the format +x (xxx) xxx-xxxx, but the pattern
(xxx) xxx-xxxx its also in that number and will return the number (478) 389-9083. To avoid duplicate numbers, after each one of the formats has
searched inside the page for all possible patterns, those numbers are confronted with one another to exclude the duplicated phone. In this example,
the code will get the smallest number and compare with the bigger one, if the smallest is equal to the final digits of the bigger phone,it's because
they are the same number but the larger number has more information, in this example, the country code. So the code keeps the number that has more
information and discards the other.
2 - Any logo found
The code will look for the logo considering 3 different possibilities:
a - Inside the "a" links that contains the name logo if those links have an image.
b - Inside all the "divs" that contains images and the name logo in some part of the image link.
c - It will search again inside the "a" links, but will search if the title or class has the name "logo". 

After that, the final information is added to the yield and exported to a json file.
